## Understanding the Result Table:

The Result table contains a lot of different parameters which can be pretty overwhelming to the new users, so here's the description and significance of each parameter.

| Sr | Parameter | Description | Example |
|:---:|:---:|:---|:---|
|1|**Stock**|This is a NSE scrip symbol. If your OS/Terminal supports unicode, You can directly open **[TradingView](https://in.tradingview.com/)** charts by pressing `Ctrl+Click` on the stock name.|[TATAMOTORS](https://in.tradingview.com/chart?symbol=NSE%3ATATAMOTORS)|
|2|**Consolidating**|It gives the price range in which stock is trading since last `N` days. `N` is configurable and can be modified by executing `Edit User Configuration` option.|If stock is trading between price 100-120 in last 30 days, Output will be `Range = 20.0 %`|
|3|**Breakout (N Days)**|This is pure magic! The `BO` is Breakout level in last N days while `R` is the next resistance level if available. Investor should consider both BO & R level to decide entry/exits in their trades.|`B:302, R:313`(Breakout level is 100 & Next resistance is 102)|
|4|**LTP**|LTP is the Last Traded Price of an asset traded on NSE.|`298.7` (Stock is trading at this price)|
|5|**Volume**|Volume shows the relative volume of the recent candle with respect to 20 period MA of Volume. It could be `Unknown` for newly listed stocks.|if 20MA(Volume) is 1M and todays Volume is 2.8M, then `Volume = 2.8x`|
|6|**MA-Signal**|It describes the price trend of an asset by analysing various 50-200 MA/EMA crossover strategies.|`200MA-Support`,`BullCross-50MA` etc|
|7|**RSI**|For the momentum traders, it describes 14-period RSI for quick decision making about their trading plans|`0 to 100`|
|8|**Trend**|By using advance algorithms, the average trendlines are computed for `N` days and their strenght is displayed depending on steepness of trendlines. (This does NOT show any trendline on chart, it is calculated internally)|`Strong Up`, `Weak Down` etc.|
|9|**Pattern**|If the chart or the candle itself forming any important pattern in the recent timeframe or as per the selected screening option, various important patterns will be indicated here.|`Momentum Gainer`, `Inside Bar (N)`,`Bullish Engulfing` etc.|

## Hack it your way:
Feel free to Edit the parameters in the `pkscreener.ini` file which will be generated by the application.
```
[config]
period = 300d
daystolookback = 30
duration = 1d
minprice = 30
maxprice = 10000
volumeratio = 2
consolidationpercentage = 10
shuffle = y
cachestockdata = y
onlystagetwostocks = y
useema = n
```
Try to tweak this parameters as per your trading styles. For example, If you're comfortable with weekly charts, make `duration=5d` and so on. For intraday, you can set `period=1d and duration=5m` if you would like to calculate with 5minute candles. Set the duration to `15m` or whatever value you desire, but keep the period to `1d`. This tool, however, works best for short/mid term instead of intraday, but some scans like momentum/volume/NR4 etc can be used for screening stocks for intraday as well.
